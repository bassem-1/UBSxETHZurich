# UBSxETHZ Analytics Club Event: Synthetic Dataset Notice

## IMPORTANT NOTICE: THIS DATASET CONTAINS ENTIRELY SYNTHETIC DATA. NO REAL CLIENT, CUSTOMER, OR CONFIDENTIAL UBS INFORMATION IS INCLUDED.

### Data Composition
- All data in this repository has been synthetically generated through large language models, including OpenAI and Gemini Pro, supplemented with post-processing noice injection.
- All addresses, account numbers, financial figures, and conversation content are fictitious.
- No actual UBS client accounts, transactions, personal information, or proprietary bank data has been used.
- No production data, confidential client information, or personally identifiable data has been used in the creation of this dataset.
- Any resemblance to real persons, accounts, transactions, or conversations is purely coincidental

### Purpose
This synthetic dataset has been created solely for the UBS Hackathon challenge in the Swiss {ai} Weeks to enable participants to develop and test solutions without exposure to sensitive information.

### Data Generation Methodology
This synthetic dataset was created through a three-stage automated process:

**Task and Topic Generation:**
- Tasks are generated using predefined templates with parameter values based on field strategies defined in the templates. Most parameter values are randomly generated within a range of possible values of the strategy, or are a static choice. Templates and parameter values do not include any real data. A list of generic topics has been compiled that do not contain any real identifiable data.

**Transcript Generation:**
- Call transcripts are generated based on the synthetic tasks and topics. Each transcript includes standardized greetings and task-specific dialogue snippets. Dialogue content does not reflect actual customer interactions. The structure, format, and templates used for transcript generation are not based on or derived from actual bank call transcripts, customer service scripts, or real conversational patterns. 

**Distortions**
- After the generation of the snippets, additional modulators are applied to inject noise in the dataset.

### Usage Terms
- This data is provided only for participants of the UBS x ETH ZÃ¼rich Analytics Club
- Data may not be redistributed outside of hackathon context
- Participants must delete all copies upon hackathon completion
- Commercial use of this dataset is prohibited

### Legal Disclaimer
UBS makes no warranties regarding the accuracy, completeness, or fitness for purpose of this synthetic data. The generated content does not represent actual customer service practices, procedures, or interactions. UBS shall not be liable for any damages arising from use of this dataset.
