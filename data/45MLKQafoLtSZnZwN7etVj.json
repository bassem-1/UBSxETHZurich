I'm calling to discuss the topics of our meeting, including the issue you've encountered with our digital banking application and updating your KYC details. How are you tody?\n\nSpeaker 1:Oh, hi... uh, I'm doing okay, thanks.\n\nSpeaker 2:Before we proceed, ay I please you to confirm your date of birth and address for security purposes?\n\nSpeaker 1:Sure, my date of birth is DATE and my address is ADDRESS.\n\nSpeaker 2:Thank you for confirming your Mr. NAME. Let's address the issue with digital banking application first. I un derstand you're looking for a specific feature. Could please describe the feature you're to find and why it is important foryour banking experience? This will help us understand your needs better and provide appropriate alternatives next steps.\n\nSpeaker 1:Right, uh, the feature I'm looking for the t o up automatic transfers from my checking account my savings account specific schedule. This would help manage my finances more effectively and ensure that regularly without having to think about each month. Does the app provied a to set this up? If not, are there any other solutions you can recommend to achieve the same functionality?\n\nSpeaker 2:I completely understand how having automatic transfers set would makemanaging your finances much easier. Uh, currently, our digital banking application doesn't support up automatic transfers for specific and schedules directly withint he app. However, you do have a couple of alternatives.\n\nSpeaker 2:Firstly, you can use our standing order feature, which will allow you to set up recurring transfers from your checking account to savings account. This can be arranged to occur weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly, similar to the automatic transferfeature were hoping for, although it won't provide quite same level of\n\nSpeaker 1:Mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker 2:Secondly, you can still manually transfer funds between your accounts using the app anytime, which offers a bit more control. I can guide through setting up a standing order if that works for you.\n\nSpeaker 2:At this moment, we're taking note of all feature requests from our clients. This automatic transfer feature has been requested by several other clients as well, so it is something we're looking to add in future updates. Your feedback is valuable and will be logged for consideration by our development team.\n\nSpeaker 2:Would you like assistance with settin up a standing order, or you any other questions about current features or the process of requesting new ones?\n\nSpeaker 1:I appreciate the alternatives you've mentioned, but I'm skeptical about whether the standing order feature truly meets my needs. It's not just about the automatictransfer itself; having the flexibility to specify exact dates and revise them if needed is key for effective financial management. Could you shed more light on any potential inconveniences this might cause? Additionally, do you know when the development team might consider integrating the fully automated transfer feature into the app? It feels like a significant in a modern banking platform.\n\nSpeaker 1:I have some questions the KYC update you mentioned Retarding my intent to invest for retirement. Whta specific details d o you from me, and will there be any documentation required? Also, will updating this information provide better investment recommendations?\n\nSpeaker 2:I completely understand skepticism, Mr. NAME. The absence of precise scheduling for automatic transfers can indeed be seen as a limitation for those who wish to have more control over their finances. While the standing order feature does offer a level of automation, lacks the detailed customization you described.\n\nSpeaker 2:Regarding potential if you have variable income or expenses that make fixed scheduling impractical, relying solely on standing orders might require more manual adjustments. you can still review and adjust these orders as needed via our app. I note your concern and will log this feedback to empahsize the necessity of flexible scheduling for future\n\nSpeaker 1:Got it.\n\nSpeaker 2:Typically, our development team evaporates feature requests quarterly, so might still be a waiting period before any new While I don't have a specific timeline, rest assured that this is a popula request and is on their radar.
